## project Overview
this is my personal journal for a hardware hacking project, specifically the Halo 3c air/temp/vape/sound(?) sensor.
it's a mix of reverse engineering, testing, figuring exactly how this thing works.

## current setup.
- target device: HALO Smart Sensor 3C
- tools: mostly avaliable at the [PDX CTRLH Hackerspace](https://pdxhackerspace.org)

## what i'm doing:
- documenting the proccess of hacking into the target device.
- reverse-engineering the hardware and firmware.
- testing different ways to interact with it.

## next steps:
**as of 02/13/2025 it's on the way and expected to get to my house at 02/24/2025**
